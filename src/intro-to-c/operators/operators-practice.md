# Arithmetic Operators Practice
By Nicole Zolnier

A fun thing to do in these exercises is to create a separate function and call it in main. That way, you can have your own library of functions and reuse it if you need. 

1. Write a function that takes 5 numbers and returns the sum and average (in two decimal places) of them.

2. Write a function that receives a number and returns whether it is even or odd.

3. Write a function that receives a number and returns if the number is divisible by 3.

4. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns which one is higher.

5. Write a function that takes three numbers, the sides of a triangle and returns whether the triangle formed by the given sides is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
