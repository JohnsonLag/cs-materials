# Strings Practice

A fun thing to do in these exercises is to create a separate function and call it in main. That way, you can have your own library of functions and reuse it if you need.

1. Write a function that receives a string and return its length without using any libraries.

2. Write a function that receives a string and turns it into uppercase.

3. Write a function that receives two strings and checks if they are equal.

4. Write a function that receives a string and check if it is a palindrome.

5. Write a function that receives a string and reverses it.

6. **CHALLENGE:** How would you read a first and last name from the terminal, save it to a string, and display it to the screen?
