A fun thing to do in these exercises is to create a separate function and call it in main. That way, you can have your own library of functions and reuse it if you need.

@. Write a function that takes 5 numbers and returns the sum and average (in two decimal places) of them.

@. Write a function that receives a number and returns whether it is even or odd.

@. Write a function that receives a number and returns if the number is divisible by 3.

@. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns which one is higher.

@. Write a function that takes three numbers, the sides of a triangle and returns whether the triangle formed by the given sides is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

@. Assign this expression to a float. You can do this in a single line without writing a main function.

$$\frac{2x+7y-13}{37^2+z}$$

@. Multiply an integer by 8, another integer by 32, and divide a third integer by 4, all using bitwise operators. You do not need to write a main function.
